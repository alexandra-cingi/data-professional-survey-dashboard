# Data Professional Survey: Interactive Power BI Dashboard

### Project Overview

This project transforms raw survey data from over 600 data professionals into an interactive Power BI dashboard. The goal was to visualise the current state of the data industry, focusing on salary trends, job satisfaction, and the most popular programming languages across different job roles.

The "Colonel" of the Analysis

The dashboard provides a high-level view of the data profession, answering key questions such as:

Salary Benchmarking: What is the average salary for a Data Analyst vs. a Data Scientist?

Tool Popularity: Which languages (Python, R, SQL) are most dominant in the field?

Work-Life Balance: How does job satisfaction vary by job title and remote work status?

Demographics: A breakdown of the global reach of the data professional community.

Technical Features

Data Transformation (Power Query): Cleaned and reshaped messy survey responses, handled null values, and standardised job titles.

DAX Calculations: Created measures for "Average Salary," "Total Respondents," and "Happiness Rating."

Interactive Visuals:

Slicers: Allow users to filter the entire report by Country, Job Title, or Favourite Language.

Treemaps & Gauge Charts: To show the distribution of programming languages and overall satisfaction levels.

Map Visuals: To display the geographic distribution of survey participants.

Key Insights

The Python Dominance: Visual evidence of Python being the "favourite" language among Data Analysts.

The "Happiness" Metric: Identifying which roles report the highest levels of professional satisfaction.

Industry Salaries: A clear visualization of how years of experience correlate with salary bands.
